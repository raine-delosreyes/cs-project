				<li><h2>1.	Move for at least 30 minutes a day.<h2></li>
					<p>Are you required to do a 30-minute, high-intensity <a href="glossary.html#workout">workout</a> every day? You may, but it is better to start simple, such as taking a morning jog or learning a dance choreography. If 30 minutes is too much for you, you may also divide it into parts, like taking three 10-minute strolls a day.</p>

					<p>Make sure to get a daily dose of sunlight. Exposure to sunlight is said to increase the brain’s release of a hormone called serotonin. Moreover, sunlight contains a radiant energy called UV-B, which provides energy for your skin to make vitamin D. Before you go out, remember to put on sunscreen.</p>
